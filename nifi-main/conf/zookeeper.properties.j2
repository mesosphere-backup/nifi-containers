# Specifies the servers that are part of this zookeeper ensemble. For
# every NiFi instance running an embedded zookeeper, there needs to be
# a server entry below. For instance:
#
# server.1=nifi-node1-hostname:2888:3888
# server.2=nifi-node2-hostname:2888:3888
# server.3=nifi-node3-hostname:2888:3888
#
# The index of the server corresponds to the myid file that gets created
# in the dataDir of each node running an embedded zookeeper. See the
# administration guide for more details.
#

# Example for container use: ZOOKEEPER_SERVER_1="server.1=nifi-node1-hostname:2888:3888"
